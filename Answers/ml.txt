Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform
 tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves 
computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. 
For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms
 telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem
 at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced 
tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed
 algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help
 the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers
 specify every needed step.[7]

The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach 
computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is 
available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one
 approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid. This can then
 be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) 
it uses to determine correct answers. For example, to train a system for
 the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten
 digits has often been used.
