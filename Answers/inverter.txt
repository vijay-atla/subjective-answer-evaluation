A power inverter, or inverter , is a power electronic device or circuitary
that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current(AC). the resulting
AC frequently obtained depends on the particular device employed.
Inverters do the opposite of "converters" which were originally large 
electromechanical devices converting AC to DC.
The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling 
depend on the design of the specific device or circuitary. the inverter does not
 produce any power, the power is provided by the DC source.
